    Notes for Autonomous: To avoid use of timer, instead make a variable in the opmode "stepDone" and set its condition to be true whenever the given task is completed.
     Then, finish every step with

     if (stepDone){
        stepDone = false;
        step++;
        break;
     }







     ALWAYS SET POWER TO 0 FOR ENCODERS
